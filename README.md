# BitCanna Raspberry Pi Wallet Installation Guide
BitCanna Raspberry Pi Wallet Installation Guide

WARNING!

This is still a WiP (Work in Progress) project a lot of changes will be made along the way so use any intrusctions described below at you own risk!!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These instrusctions have been divided into 2 guides for the fact that despite being both for Raspberry Pi usage, the Virtual Machine Raspberry OS and the actual Raspeberry OS differ a bit from each other which requires a few different steps on each method.

NOTE:

The Virtual Machine version, allows the usage of the wallet eihter through the CLI environment as well as ther GUI environment

The Raspberry version for now only allows the usage of the CLI environment, to use the GUI you will need to spend an aditional 40h-50h to manually install the QT5 software required to run the wallet with the GUI.
