 ## What is it? 

This are 2 Guides that were created to help those among the BitCanna Community interested to run their Full Node Wallets(*) using a Raspberry Pi.

*The possibility to use it as a Masternode is still to be tested.

 ## Requirements

 - Raspberry Pi 3B+  
 - SD Card with 32GB (minimum)
 - PC (either for remote controll the RPi or for the VM installation Guide) 
 
 ## Important 

The following Guides follow a strict order of steps, commands and files editions that must be followed to have a successful result in compiling and installing the BitCanna Full Node Wallet on a Raspberry Pi OS environment.

These instructions have been divided into 2 guides for the fact that despite being both for Raspberry Pi usage, the Raspberry OS used on the Virtual Machine and the Raspberry OS used on an actual Raspberry Pi differ a bit from each other which requires a few different steps on each in order for the wallet to be installed and used.

 ## Installation
 
 *   [Virtual Machine Installation Guide](#virtual-machine-installation-guide "Virtual Machine Installation Guide")
 *   [Raspberry Pi Installation Guide](#raspberry-pi-installation-guide "Raspberry Pi Installation Guide")
